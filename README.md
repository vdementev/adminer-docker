# Adminer 5 docker image


## Tags

- `latest`, `mysql-nginx` - nginx and php-fpm version on port 8080. RECOMENDED
- `mysql-standalone` - standalone version using php build-in web server on port 8080.

## Disclaimer

I created this Docker image for my personal workflow, so it hasn't been tested in use cases beyond those I regularly work with.
